# `awsm` Implementation Summary

## Key Recommendations

### Programming Language
**Go** is the recommended language for implementing the `awsm` tool due to:
- Excellent performance and cross-platform support
- Compilation to a single binary with no runtime dependencies
- Strong TUI libraries (Bubble Tea) and CLI frameworks (Cobra)
- Official AWS SDK with comprehensive service coverage
- Good balance between development speed and performance

### Core Features
The `awsm` tool should provide:

1. **Improved Command Interface**
   - Intuitive command structure and shortened commands
   - Enhanced output formatting and error messages
   - Smart defaults and command templates

2. **Interactive TUI Mode**
   - Resource navigation and visualization
   - Dashboard views and context menus
   - Keyboard shortcuts for efficient operation

3. **Multi-Context Management**
   - Easy profile and region switching
   - Visual indicators for current context
   - Multi-region views

4. **Priority AWS Services**
   - EC2, S3, and Lambda as primary focus
   - IAM, CloudFormation, and CloudWatch as secondary focus

### Architecture
A modular architecture with:
- Clear separation between interface, core logic, and AWS service interactions
- Dual interface support (CLI and TUI) sharing core components
- Service adapters for AWS service interactions
- Configuration and state management for user preferences and caching

### Implementation Strategy
A phased approach:

1. **Phase 1 (MVP, 3-4 months)**
   - Core CLI improvements for EC2, S3, and Lambda
   - Basic TUI for resource navigation
   - Profile and region management
   - Improved output formatting and error handling

2. **Phase 2 (2-3 months)**
   - Extended service coverage
   - Advanced TUI features
   - Workflows and automation
   - Command templates and favorites

3. **Phase 3 (2-3 months)**
   - Resource relationship visualization
   - Multi-region and multi-account views
   - Plugin system and advanced customization

### Key Dependencies
- **AWS SDK**: aws-sdk-go-v2
- **TUI**: Bubble Tea, Bubbles, Lip Gloss
- **CLI**: Cobra, Viper
- **Data Processing**: go-jmespath, go-prettyjson, tablewriter
- **Storage**: bbolt, go-cache

## Next Steps

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Go module and repository structure
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure development environment

2. **Core Framework Development**
   - Implement AWS client wrapper
   - Create configuration management system
   - Develop command parsing framework

3. **Initial Service Implementation**
   - Start with EC2, S3, and Lambda adapters
   - Implement basic operations for each service

4. **Interface Development**
   - Develop CLI command structure
   - Create TUI components and views
   - Implement shared functionality

5. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Unit and integration testing
   - User testing and feedback collection
   - Performance optimization

## Conclusion

The `awsm` tool has the potential to significantly improve the AWS CLI experience by providing a more intuitive interface, enhanced productivity features, and better visualization of AWS resources. By implementing it in Go with a modular architecture and following a phased approach, the project can deliver a high-quality tool that enhances productivity for AWS users across platforms.
